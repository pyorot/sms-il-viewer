# SMS IL Tracker Viewer

This is a simple web project made with no libraries beyond jQuery. It's a **leaderboard tracker** for Super Mario Sunshine individual-level speedruns, and is currently live [here](https://smsilview.netlify.app). **v1 was published on 2023/06/20.**

The folders 0.1 and 0.2 contain old development versions. The folder 0 contains the current WIP version. It's not on a separate branch because I need to publish it as I work on it to test it on mobile. The **dev version** will always be accessible [here](https://smsilview.netlify.app/0).
